      <!--A brief description of Beijing-->
      <p>Beijing, with its acient history goes back to 3000 years. Chinese food in Beijing is phenomenal you have dined at local chinese resturaunts but it does not compare
         to the food in Beijing itself. In Beijing you will experience what true chinese food is. Although, most menus are written in chinese so it may be difficult to understand
         what you are going to order. The buildings in Beijing are breathtaking it is nothing compared to where you live. The architecture is complex, built with impressive walls,
         gates, and unique roof designs you definitely want to visit some famous tourist attractions like the Forbidden City. You can also see pandas in Beijing. Pandas are known 
         to represent China as a whole. You can see them at the Beijing Zoo and feed them bamboo.
