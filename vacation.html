      <b>This is a beautiful picture of an island in Greece called <i>Santorini.</i></b>
      <!--Added a brief description of Greece using the p tag-->
      <p>Greece is a beautiful country to visit, with many attractions to visit, beautiful landscapes, and delicious food. 
        Greece has over 2000 islands and only 170 of those islands are inhabited.
        The capital of Greece is Athens, bordered by the Aegan Sea all the way to the southern area of the Mediterranean Sea.
        The weather is always perfect in Greece since its located towards the south so during the spring, summer, and the fall it is lovely.
        Be sure to visit the beaches there too. Every island has its own beach which very few tourists visit. Make sure to relax by the beach
        after all the museums and temples you visit.</p>
