      <!--Included a brief description of VALORANT using the p tag-->
      <p>VALORANT was developed by Riot Games. The Creator of a popular game called League of Legends decided to make a FPS game. 
         Through the years Riot Games came up with VALORANT. It is an extremely entertaining game to play with several different agents to pick from
         and includes cool looking cosmetics. VALORANT is a 5 vs 5 player game where players will take turns defending a site
         or attacking a site. Each game consists of 24 rounds or if you exceed overtime it can take over 24 rounds. The first team to win 13 rounds wins the game.
         Each team must play 12 rounds of attack or defence. Each player must select a unique agent to play and each of these agents have responsibilities to help
         get on to the site they are attacking or to defend a site they are defending.
